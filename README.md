After lots discussions with several veteran contributors of Soulseek, This app is going to go thru lots of changes, and will be released after all these have been implemented. 

1. Users will be forced to take a test to know whether they are even able to tell difference between High quality and low quality music
2. No streaming, no opt out for sharing files, deleting any files will be met with penalties such as harsh rate limits
3. The app won't have any social aspect of soulseek
4. Sharing files will be the core feature of the app


This project was made with Electron(ðŸ’”) and Pynicotine
